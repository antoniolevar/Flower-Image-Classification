# Image Classification with Deep Learning
This project implements an image classification model using deep learning techniques to classify images of flowers into multiple categories. The project involves data preparation, model training, evaluation, and comparison of different architectures like InceptionV3 and Xception.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify images of flowers into predefined classes. This involves:

Data preprocessing and augmentation
Model building using transfer learning
Model training and evaluation
Comparison of performance metrics across different architectures
Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries (listed below)

Install dependencies with:
pip install tensorflow keras scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib

Project Structure
Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the dataset, including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
Model Building: Use transfer learning with InceptionV3 and Xception architectures to build and compile classification models.
Training and Evaluation: Train each model and evaluate performance on validation data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
Results Analysis: Visualize training history and evaluate model metrics to compare the effectiveness of different models.
Key Steps and Code
Data Loading: Uses ImageDataGenerator for loading and augmenting images.
Model Architecture: Transfer learning models are created using pre-trained networks (InceptionV3 and Xception).
Performance Evaluation: Performance metrics are calculated, and training history is visualized to assess model improvements.
Example Usage
To run the project, open the Jupyter notebook and execute each cell in sequence. Ensure that you have the data in the correct file paths.
